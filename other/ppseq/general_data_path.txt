make a recording (ephys, behaviour and cameras)
transfer this data onto ceph
kilosort the spikes
run the video tracking on the camera 
align the behavior and cameras to the ephys (code for these steps in "Postprocess_Neuropixel")
put all of these processed data together into a specific file structure (animalid_implant_recording/recordingdate/...)
extract spikes which will be used for ppseq
run ppseq on awake
extract sleep spikes for ppseq
run ppseq on sleep
run my PPseq postprocessing scripts to extract replays
analyse the replay
